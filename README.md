# Protein Localization Datasets

| name | Description | source |
|---|---|---|
| psort-neg-v2 |  1591 Gram-negative bacterial proteins, labeled with 5 subcellular locations. Each file in the `psort-neg-v2` contains proteins that are associated to a single location | [web-page](https://www.psort.org/dataset/datasetv2.html) |
| deeploc |  13858 proteins entries categorized
into 10 subcellular locations. The file is a fasta file composed by header and sequence. The header is composed by the accession number from Uniprot, the annotated subcellular localization and possibly a description field indicating if the protein was part of the test set. The subcellular localization includes an additional label, where S indicates soluble, M membrane and U unknown.  | [web-page](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc/data.php) |
